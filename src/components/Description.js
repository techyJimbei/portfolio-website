    <h2>ANDROID DEVELOPER</h2>
    <p>
    I’m Shruti Malviya, an Android Developer with a deep passion for crafting seamless and visually engaging mobile applications. I specialize in building modern Android apps using Jetpack Compose, backed by robust Java full-stack development.

My work is driven by a strong sense of design thinking and technical precision — I strive to create applications that not only function flawlessly but also deliver intuitive and delightful user experiences. From clean architecture to elegant UI, I focus on writing scalable, maintainable code that brings ideas to life with creativity and purpose.

Every project is an opportunity for me to blend innovation with usability, and I’m always excited to explore the next challenge that lets me push the boundaries of what mobile technology can do.
